# arduino based industrial safety system
 This project is a compact, real-time safety monitoring system designed for industrial environments. Built around an Arduino Uno, it integrates a DHT11 temperature sensor, MQ-2 (or MQ-135) gas sensor, and a flame sensor to detect abnormal temperature spikes, hazardous gas leaks, and fire presence. Alert signals are displayed using LED indicators, ensuring quick visual feedback without the need for buzzers or displays. The system enhances workplace safety by offering an efficient, cost-effective solution for early threat detection, and can be easily upgraded for IoT-based monitoring and data logging.
